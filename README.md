Data used is from FyersAPI and backtest results are from January 2018 till August 2024. The strategy says buy and sell Nifty futures at 9:16 in the morning and either sell at a 100 points loss or wait and exit at 3:15 pm. 
I have also included backtest from Algotest to compare if my results are right or not and it matches with Algotest results.
